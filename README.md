# Hubot Team [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-team.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hubot-team)

Create and manage the members of a team using Hubot.


## Installation

Add **hubot-team** to your `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "hubot-team": "latest"
}
```

Add **hubot-team** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```json
["hubot-team"]
```

Run `npm install hubot-team`.


## Configuration

Some commands require an admin role to be run (e.g. `clear` team list). The
admins can be specified through the `HUBOT_TEAM_ADMIN` environment variable
as a comma-separated list of usernames.


## Commands

    hubot create <team_name> team               # create team called <team_name>
    hubot (delete|remove) <team_name> team      # delete team called <team_name>
    hubot list teams                            # list all existing teams
    hubot (<team_name>) team +1                 # add me to the team
    hubot (<team_name>) team -1                 # remove me from the team
    hubot (<team_name>) team add (me|<user>)    # add me or <user> to team
    hubot (<team_name>) team remove (me|<user>) # remove me or <user> from team
    hubot (<team_name>) team (list|show)        # list the people in the team
    hubot (<team_name>) team (empty|clear)      # clear team list
    hubot (<team_name>) team count              # list the current size of the team

The `<team_name>` argument can be omitted from all commands where it appears in parentheses. For example:

    hubot team +1

would work just fine, adding the current user to the default team. Note: when
adding and removing users without the `<team_name>` label, those users are
included in a team that does not show up when running `hubot list teams`.
